<h2>The best movies that I have watched!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>About Time</h3>
<p>This is my favourite romance movie, about a man who discovers the men in his family can travel in time.</p>
<h3>Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite French movies, about a man from the trency south of France, who moves to an area in Northern France, called Les Ch'tis. The dialect they speak is very strange and there is a lot of confusion. Very funny IMO.</p>
<h3>Pride</h3>
<p>I love this LGBTQ+ movie. It's definitely a tearjerker but extremely heartwarming at the same time!</p>
